### React Application Setup with Vite
Overview
This README provides a step-by-step guide on setting up a React application using Vite. Vite is a fast development server and build tool for modern web development, designed to optimize the development experience.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

Node.js: Download and Install Node.js
npm: npm is included with Node.js. However, it's recommended to use a version manager like nvm for better control over Node.js versions.
Getting Started
### Initialize a new React project using Vite:

npx create-vite my-react-app --template react
Navigate to the project directory:
cd my-react-app
Install dependencies:

```bash

npm install
This installs all the required dependencies specified in the package.json file.

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
The development server will be running at http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in your browser to view your React application.

Additional Commands
Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
This command generates a production-ready build of your application in the dist directory.

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
This command serves the production build locally for previewing before deployment.

Lint and fix files:

```bash
npm run lint
This command uses ESLint to lint your code and automatically fix any fixable issues.

Customize Configuration
Vite allows you to customize various aspects of your project. Refer to the Vite Configuration Documentation for details on how to modify the default configuration.
